# Backend Codebase Analysis and Improvement Todo

## Codebase Analysis
- [x] Clone the repository
- [x] Set up environment variables (.env file)
- [x] Examine package.json dependencies
- [x] Review project directory structure
- [x] Review API documentation
- [x] Review features documentation
- [x] Examine server.js and main application setup
- [x] Review authentication implementation
- [x] Review database models and schemas
- [x] Review API routes and controllers
- [x] Review socket implementation for multiplayer features

## Issue Identification
- [x] Identify bugs or errors in the codebase
- [x] Check for security vulnerabilities
- [x] Evaluate performance bottlenecks
- [x] Identify missing features from documentation
- [x] Check for code quality and maintainability issues

## Identified Issues and Improvements
1. **Security Issues**:
   - Hardcoded credentials in demo user creation (auth.controller.js)
   - JWT secret key needs to be changed from default in .env
   - Missing rate limiting for authentication endpoints
   - Sensitive information exposure in error responses

2. **API Issues**:
   - Registration endpoint URL is incorrect in API documentation (shows `6` instead of `/auth/register`)
   - Missing validation for some API inputs
   - Inconsistent error handling across controllers

3. **Database Connection**:
   - No retry mechanism for database connection failures
   - Long MongoDB connection timeout settings

4. **Socket Implementation**:
   - Missing error handling in some socket events
   - Potential memory leak in setTimeout for question timer
   - User reference in game.socket.js but User model not imported

5. **Code Quality**:
   - Inconsistent logging (mix of console.log and logger utility)
   - Missing JSDoc comments in many functions
   - Duplicate code in demo user creation functions

6. **Performance**:
   - No caching mechanism for frequently accessed data
   - No pagination for leaderboard and game results

7. **Missing Features**:
   - Incomplete implementation of Apple OAuth (placeholder only)
   - Token blacklisting for logout not implemented
   - Incomplete student verification process

## Requirements Gathering
- [x] List specific issues to fix
- [x] List improvements to implement
- [x] Prioritize changes based on importance
- [x] Discuss and confirm changes with user

### Prioritized Issues (Based on User Feedback)
1. Core functionality issues related to real-time multiplayer
2. Authentication and security issues
3. Tier-specific features implementation
4. API tester interface with demo users for each tier

## Implementation
- [ ] Implement fixes for identified issues
- [ ] Implement requested improvements
- [ ] Update documentation if necessary
- [ ] Test changes to ensure functionality

## Delivery
- [ ] Prepare summary of changes made
- [ ] Provide instructions for deployment
- [ ] Deliver updated codebase
